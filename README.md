# 💼 Personal Portfolio Website

Hey! I'm Mohit Rathore and this is my personal portfolio — made with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no fancy frameworks). Just clean, responsive code showing who I am, what I do, and the kind of work I enjoy building.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive layout
- Smooth scroll and transitions
- Simple, clean design (my style)
- Project showcase section
- Contact form (non-functional/demo)

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## 🧠 Inspiration

Honestly, I was tired of not having my own spot on the web. So I sat down, opened VS Code, and just started building. This is the result.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m a frontend developer who loves building clean UIs, experimenting with layout ideas, and tweaking the tiniest details until they feel right. I like making websites that don’t just look good but feel good to use.
